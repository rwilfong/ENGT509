ENGT509: Applied Computational Methods

Simulating disease transmission using variations of Conway's Game of Life

#### Method 1 
- One infected individual can spread to as mny susceptible individuals as they want, as long as they are within 1 cell of one another

#### Method 2
- An infected individual can only infect a set number of susceptible cells within 1 cell.

#### Method 3 
- Introduction of the vaccinated group. One infected individual can still infect as many suspectible individuals as they want. Number of vaccinated individuals defined by user input.

#### Method 4 
- Introduction of a randomly shuffled matrix. In previous methods, the matrix was static. In this method, the matrix will randomly shuffle after each iteration to show a more dynamic spread of disease.

#### Method 5 
- Change in transmission of the disease. Previously, the disease was assumed to be 100% transmittable. In this simulation, the user can define the probability of the disease transferring.
